# Automating Literature Reviews using Deep Learning Methods

## Introduction
Literature reviews play a crucial role in academic research, providing a comprehensive overview of existing
knowledge on a particular topic. They are often times carried out at universities and pharmaceutical companies
and require an extensive amount of reading and analysis of scientific publications.

A typical way of conducting a manual literature review consists of several steps.
First, a huge database, such as PubMed, is queried for thousands of papers based on some keywords and basic criteria
that are determined beforehand and that describe the given topic.
Next, all titles and abstracts of the returned papers are manually read and a small percentage (3-5 %) is selected
for further review. This is guided by more precise criteria that are too complicated for data base querying.
Finally, a full text review is performed on the remaining papers to filter
