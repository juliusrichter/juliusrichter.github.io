# Automating Literature Reviews using Deep Learning Methods

### Introduction
Literature reviews play a crucial role in academic research, providing a comprehensive overview of existing knowledge on a particular topic. They are often times carried out at universities and pharmaceutical companiesand require an extensive amount of reading and analysis of scientific publications.

A typical way of conducting a manual literature review consists of several steps.
First, a huge database, such as PubMed, is queried for thousands of studies based on some keywords and basic criteria
that are determined beforehand and describe the given topic.
Next, all titles and abstracts of the returned studies are manually read and a small percentage (3-5 %) is selected
for further review. This is guided by more precise criteria that are too complicated for data base querying.
Finally, a full text review is performed on the remaining studies in order to make sure that only the relevant ones are
included.

However, given the time-consuming nature of reading thousands of abstracts and hundreds of full studies, there is growing interest in automating certain aspects of literature reviews.
Besides saving time, other benefits of automation include a potentially improved accuracy and objectivity, as human error can be minimized and a difference in approaches by different people is avoided. Additionally, automation tools can efficiently search across various databases and sources, ensuring a more comprehensive coverage of relevant studies.

With litverse using the GPT-4 API for an important step in the automated literature review process, we will look deeper into how language models like GPT-4 work exactly.

### Language models




### Reflection
With the emergence of language models and other sophisticated deep learning models come many changes to our everyday life.
Language models can assist in content creation, such as generating drafts, writing summaries, or suggesting creative ideas. They can also facilitate real-time translation which is a huge step towards breaking language barriers and enables much more effective communication. Additionally, language models power chatbots like ChatGPT, opening up a completely new way of using the internet to access information.
